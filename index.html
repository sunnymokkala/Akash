<h1> A Life with No Color </h1>

<p>
Our world of innocence was caught unaware,<br>
Taunted by a malicious nightmare,<br>
Locked inside for the foreseeing future,<br>
An experiment gone wrong; a distorted sculpture.<br>
</p>

<p>
We wait through day for that word of relief,<br>
Citizens spiral into psychotic belief,<br>
“Lives have been lost” says the newspaper ad,<br>
Coronavirus is sending people mad.<br>
</p>

<p>
Where to go; what to do,<br>
We try our best to struggle through,<br>
The roads are clear from cars and bikes,<br>
No long walks or country hikes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Isolated from family and friends,<br>
Trapped inside till the crisis ends,<br>
Can we survive this helpless attack?,<br>
A life with no colour: only black.<br>
